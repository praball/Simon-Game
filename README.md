## Summary

This is an interactive Simon Game written in VanillaJS/CSS/HTML to simulate the classic Simon Electronic Memory Game.

## Getting Started

This game is written in JavaScript with some ES6 feature used, so you only need a modern browser that supports ES6 to play the game! Check if your browser support ES6: [ECMAScript 6 compatibility table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)

### Game Rule
Each level will have different set(s) of button blink, player must follow the order of how the button blink and click the corresponding button in order. If all buttons were click correctly, player will enter next level and have a more complex set of challenge as the game progresses to higher levels. Good luck!
